## Sensei

This project uses Sensei to prevent architectural drift. Before editing files
in protected directories, consult the awareness graph.

Sensei also installs the **Sensei Architect** skill. For architecture-sensitive
planning, implementation, debugging, review, recovery, migration, security, or
state/convergence work, load `.sensei/skills/sensei-architect/SKILL.md` before
planning or editing. Claude Code can also discover the native project skill at
`.claude/skills/sensei-architect/`. Use MCP tools when configured and CLI
fallbacks otherwise. Stay proportional to the risk and preserve durable lessons
with `sensei propose`.

### Behavioral guidelines

General discipline that applies to every change (paraphrased from Andrej
Karpathy's observations on how LLMs fail at coding — the popular
[`andrej-karpathy-skills`](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills)
CLAUDE.md). Sensei adds the *repo-specific* rules below; these are the *general*
ones:

1. **Think before coding.** State your assumptions out loud. If the request is
   ambiguous, ask. If a simpler approach exists, push back. When you are
   confused, stop and name what is unclear — do not pick one interpretation and
   run with it.
2. **Simplicity first.** Write the minimum code that solves the problem. No
   speculative abstractions, no flexibility nobody asked for. Would a senior
   engineer call this overcomplicated?
3. **Surgical changes.** Touch only what the task requires. Do not improve
   neighboring code or refactor what is not broken. Every changed line should
   trace back to the request.
4. **Goal-driven execution.** Turn a vague instruction into a verifiable target
   before writing a line. "Add validation" becomes "write tests for invalid
   inputs, then make them pass."

### Rules

1. **Call briefing before editing high-risk files.** Run `sensei briefing --file <path>`
   before modifying any file listed in `docs/awareness/high_risk_files.yaml`.
   Claude Code hooks enforce this automatically.

2. **Respect forbidden fixes.** The briefing output lists patterns that look
   correct but are known-broken. Do not use them. A PreToolUse hook
   (`edit-check-guard.sh`) also runs your proposed content through
   `sensei edit-check` and blocks an edit that introduces a forbidden-fix shape;
   if that fires, revise rather than force it through.

3. **Run required tests.** The briefing output lists tests that must pass
   when touching protected files. Run them before committing.

4. **End non-trivial code tasks with the AWG summary line:**
   ```
   AWG: briefing(<target>) | invariants: X, Y | uncertainty: Z
   ```

### Commands

```bash
sensei briefing --file <path>     # Context for a file edit
sensei briefing --task "desc"     # Context for a task
sensei preflight --file <path>    # Risk classification
sensei check                      # Validate YAML sources
sensei build                      # Recompile after editing YAML
```

### Adding Knowledge (one typed call)

After fixing a bug, record the scar with a single `sensei propose` call. It
appends the entry to the right YAML source, rebuilds the seed, reloads the
local store, and stages the change — then stops. **You review and commit.**

```bash
# A way the system broke (links the invariant it violated):
sensei propose --kind failure_mode --title "Stale seed served after reload" \
  --related-invariant <inv.id> --evidence "observed stale node" \
  --source-file golang/server/reload.go --required-test path_test.go:TestReloadFresh

# A test that proves the behavior now:
sensei propose --kind required_test --id "path_test.go:TestReloadFresh" \
  --title "Reload serves fresh triples" --related-failure <fm.id>

# A repair that must never be applied again:
sensei propose --kind forbidden_fix --title "Cache the reload path" \
  --related-invariant <inv.id> --description "caused the stale-serve failure"

# A repair that worked and HELD (queued for review, never auto-promoted):
sensei propose --kind applied_repair --title "Parse-check the composed document" \
  --related-failure <fm.id> --required-test path_test.go:TestComposedParses \
  --source-file golang/x/apply.go --description "what the repair did" \
  --survival-evidence "no recurrence across N runs touching this region"
```

Every entry must answer the contract-first questions: what contract was
violated/clarified, what failure we observed, what test proves it, what future
fix is forbidden, and which invariant/failure_mode it connects to. Vague notes
are rejected. If the contract is unknown, use `--kind contract_unknown` with a
`--proposed-contract` or `--revision-request`.

The `Stop` hook (`sensei feedback-check`) reminds you if a session fixed a durable
error class but added no graph feedback.
