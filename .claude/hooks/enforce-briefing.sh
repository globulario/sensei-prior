# Sensei enforce-briefing hook for Claude Code.
#
# PreToolUse hook on Edit/Write/MultiEdit: blocks edits to protected files
# unless an awareness briefing was obtained first.
#
# Install: place in .claude/hooks/ and configure in .claude/settings.json:
#   "PreToolUse": [{
#     "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit",
#     "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": ".claude/hooks/enforce-briefing.sh", "timeout": 10}]
#   }]
#
# Protection classification is delegated ENTIRELY to `sensei protection-check`
# (golang/architecture/protection) — the one canonical protection owner. This
# hook must never re-parse docs/awareness/high_risk_files.yaml itself or
# reimplement path matching; it is a thin transport adapter (contract §9).
#
# Unlike edit-check-guard.sh (which fails OPEN when the CLI is absent — a
# missing advisory check is not a safety regression), this hook fails CLOSED
# on classifier unavailability: an empty/missing manual registry must never
# be silently read as "nothing to protect" (contract §9.7, the exact
# bootstrap gap this repair closes).
#
# The record-briefing.sh PostToolUse hook creates the session marker file
# that this hook checks. The marker binds hash(repository root + repository
# domain + file path) — never hash(file path) alone — so a briefing obtained
# against the wrong loaded domain can never authorize an edit in this
# checkout (contract §3/§9 correction). The domain used here is the
# checkout's own resolved default (no explicit override — editing has no
# --domain flag), via the same `sensei repo-domain` resolver record-briefing.sh
# uses.
