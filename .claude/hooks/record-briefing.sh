# Sensei record-briefing hook for Claude Code.
#
# PostToolUse hook on awareness_briefing: records that a briefing was
# obtained so the enforce-briefing hook permits subsequent edits.
#
# Install: place in .claude/hooks/ and configure in .claude/settings.json:
#   "PostToolUse": [{
#     "matcher": "awareness_briefing",
#     "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": ".claude/hooks/record-briefing.sh", "timeout": 10}]
#   }]
#
# The marker binds hash(repository root + repository domain + file path), not
# hash(file path) alone (contract §3/§9 correction): a briefing obtained
# against one domain must never authorize an edit evaluated under a
# different loaded domain. The domain is resolved via `sensei repo-domain`
# using the SAME explicit>configured>env precedence the briefing call itself
# used, so the marker reflects exactly what data the briefing consulted.
